## Build Notes & Website Plans
I've registered the domain name mattcodes.net using AWS Route 53. I'll be building the website on this repository and uploading my work to an AWS S3 bucket which will host the site.  Then I'll just configure the domain to route to the S3 bucket and I'll have a brand new live website to work on.

The plan is to deploy my school and personal projects for my job hunt portfolio, as well as any other handy little JS web accesssible things i think might be handy.

## Project Goals
-Portfolio section - Spooling up the various backend api's from my bootcamp projects and making them web accessible will take some figuring out.  But must be done!
-Personal dashboard - to-do lists, maybe pulls in web accessible api data for weather, news headlines etc.  
-A bug tracking single page webapp for people who play FreeHolder.
