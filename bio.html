            <h4>I'm a highly motivated Full Stack Ruby on Rails developer looking for big projects my teeth into.  I got my first dev experience working on a computer game with my brother that you will find for sale on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/463800/FreeHolder/">Steam</a>.  Nearly out of Early Access!   Though since my brother was the chief engineer of that, I wanted to enhance my coding chops so i could do more!  Naturally i landed on an online bootcamp, a solid one called Flatiron, finishing their Full Stack Software Engineering certifcation.  I love that Ruby on Rails is Dynamic!  Can simply use it as a backend API and adopt a modern front end framework like React/Redux or you can make use of RoR's fullstack on its own.  Flatiron got me comfortable with either configuration.  </h4>
