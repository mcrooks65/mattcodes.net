            <p>But for the short version, this is where I'll be bringing together all my projects and experience, and use this space to deploy any new web apps i'd like to build.</p>
            <p>For the moment we'll see how far we can go with only front-end work for the dashboard, and once we get far enough along I'll work out how to deploy the backends of my portfolio projects, and decide if backend work is required for this section of the website.</p>
            <p>Down the line as things take shape we'll choose a sleeker looking css framework like Tailwind or Bootstrap.  Or perhaps something I've never used before.</p>
            <h4>
                <p>First step will be hooking in some basic css and our first bit of JS. (DONE)</p>
                <p>Now that we've put together a basic JS clock and date script lets see what other Personal Dashboard Items we can work on. Options: To-Do List (using client local storage), news updates using public APIs, same as aforementioned but for weather updates. Build out links and landing pages to future planned areas of the website.</p>
