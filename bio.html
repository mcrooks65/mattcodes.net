            <!-- <h4>I'm a highly motivated Full Stack Ruby on Rails developer looking for big projects to sink my teeth into.  I got my first dev experience working on a computer game with my brother that can be found for sale on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/463800/FreeHolder/">Steam</a>.  We're nearly out of Early Access!   Though since my brother was the chief engineer for that project, I wanted to enhance my own coding chops so I could do more!  Naturally I landed on an online bootcamp, a solid one called Flatiron, finishing their Full Stack Software Engineering certifcation.  I love that Ruby on Rails is Dynamic!  Can simply use it as a backend API and adopt a modern front end framework like React/Redux or you can make use of RoR's fullstack on its own.  Flatiron got me quite omfortable with either configuration. </h4> -->
